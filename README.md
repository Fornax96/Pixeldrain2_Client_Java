# Pixeldrain 2

![Pixeldrain Client](http://i.imgur.com/cn0lnNK.png)

Client for uploading screenshots and documents to http://pixeldra.in/

This project is no longer maintained. I figured out that Java is not the best pick for a lightweight screenshot sharing app. Especially since tray icons/menus are broken in AWT, and neither Swing nor JFX provide an alternative. I'm now looking for a way to rebuild the client with Qt.

Feel free to use for anything.
